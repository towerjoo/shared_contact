=====================================
About Mapping Config Templates
=====================================
.. note::

    This is a TODO, not finished yet.


The *templates* directory includes the most popular contact 
providers' filed_mapping.py to serve as the field mapping
config in the script.

The popular contact providers include:

* Microsoft Outlook
* ect.

Usage
===========
You just need to copy the template in *templates* to the script directory and renamed as 
*fields_mapping.py*, then you can skip step 2 to step 4 in :ref:`usage` .
